<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

(https://nawe-google-keep-clone.netlify.app/)

The Google Keep app clone is one of the projects I got to build with Zaio. The project focuses on building functionality using Javascript DOM. There are a series of functions that handle multiple events within the webapp. The functionality added includes creating notes and using local storage to set and retieve data on the browser.

The purpose:
* This project showcases the use of the Javascript DOM to add functionality to html & css code. We do this by adding event listeners for  events such as clicks,mouseover, mouseout. Additionally we create functions to add notes to local storage.
* There are crucial concepts covered by this project such as OOP which stands for Object Oriented Programming. The use of classes and objects to handle data.
* Besides the concepts covered by this project there is a cool UI implemented for the enjoyment of a normal user.

Of course the code has been made public to view, analyse and improve. Therefore you can preview the website by the links provided or view and open the code for yourself.
